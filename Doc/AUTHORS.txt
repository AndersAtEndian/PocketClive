Sources of inspiration for PocketClive
======================================

PocketClive uses code and inspiration from the following sources : 

---

FUSE - Free Unix Spectrum Emulator version 0.3.1 - (C) Philip Kendall

FUSE is an Unix Spectrum emulator that is copyrighted under the GPL 
license. PocketClive borrows freely from the source code of FUSE: 

* The Z80 CPU emulation runs on the PocketPC almost unchanged

* Parts of the keyboard emulation

* The snapshot load library

* Other bits and pieces

If looking at the source code of PocketClive the parts that are 
copied more or less unchanged reside in the PocketClive\FUSE 
directory; but bits and pieces can be found in the rest of the code. 

FUSE can be found at 
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html or at the World of 
Spectrum http://www.worldofspectrum.org.

EasyCE - Game programming framework for PocketPC - (C) Jacco Bikker

EasyCE is a library that makes it easy to develop GAPI (that is 
Microsoft Game Programming API) applications for different flavours 
of PocketPCs. PocketClive uses an almost unchanged version of EasyCE, 
the only change being that the "arcade" like font used for printing 
text has been changed to the trusty old Spectrum font. The library 
can be found at http://pocketmatrix.com/phantom.

MESS - Multi Emulator Super System - (C) The MESS Team

PocketClive does not contain any source code from the MESS project, 
but the project (and the source code) has been a major source of 
inspiration. The project can be found at http://mess.emuverse.com.

zx32 - ZX Spectrum Emulator for Windows - (C) Vaggelis Kapartzianis

The virtual keyboard in PocketClive is a highly modified version of 
the picture that can be found in the zx32 Spectrum emulator (another 
favourite of mine). This emulator can also be found at 
http://worldofspectrum.org.

A Day in the Life - Spectrum game - (C) Stephen J. Redman/Micromega

The icon for PocketClive is originally from the old Spectrum game, A 
Day in the Life (and is it not one of the best sprites ever 
produced).
